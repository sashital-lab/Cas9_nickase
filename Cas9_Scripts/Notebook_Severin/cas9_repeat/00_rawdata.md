## Karthik's request

```
We have two reps for each - SpCas9 with KMlib002 (rep3, rep4R), SaCas9 with KMlib002 (rep3, rep4R), SaCas9 with KMlib003 (rep1R, rep2R)
Could you please extract the data from these samples (similar to what you did before in 02_analysis, 03_2MM, 04_other) and add them to the existing final tables?
```

Files were already renamed

## Unzip all the raw data files

```
for fq in *.gz; do
gunzip $fq;
done
```

## Organize them into folders
```
for f in $(ls *fastq |cut -f 2 -d "-" |sort | uniq); do
  mkdir -p $f;
  mv *-${f}-*fastq $f/;
done
```
