# cas12amod_6 seed frequency table

* /work/gif/severin/sashital-lab/2020_cas9-cas12amod/cas12amod/cas12a/03_2MM_cas12amod_6

These are the original sequences for each sample.
```
process_cas12amod_6.sh:5:string="CGGTTC"
process_KM02.sh:5:string="GGAAAT"
process_KM03.sh:5:string="GGCGCG"
process_KM04.sh:5:string="ATTAAA"
```

* snpdistFreq.sh
This script will create the snp distance frequency table.


```
#!/bin/bash

cat $1 | sed s'/................$//' | awk ' BEGIN {pos=0;str=""}
    {
     max=(length($1) >= length($2))? length($1): length($2)     
     for(i=1; pos == 0 && i <= max; i++)
     {
      v1=substr("CGGTTC", i, 1)  
      v2=substr($1, i, 1)
      if(v1 != v2){ str= str i " " v1 " " v2 " " }
      }    
      print str $0; str="";
     }' | awk 'NF==7' | awk '{print $4-$1}' | sort -n  | uniq -c | sort -k 2n | awk '{print $2,$1,6-$2,$1/(6-$2)}' | awk '{print $1,$4}' > severin/$1.snpdistfreq
```

I shortened the string I am comparing it to and added a sed command that shortens each of the strings I am comparing. I also had to use NF==7 because I was cutting from the end which removed the number of SNP info as well.


### this section is included for completeness but was performed prior when I did the 14 base non-seed part
* Need to also grab only those that have 2 snps.

```
files=$(ls ../*stats.txt)

for file in $files
do
awk '$2==2' $file > ${file}.twoonly
done &
```

Then we can create the counts tables.

```
cd severin
module load parallel
mkdir severin
parallel "./snpdistFreq.sh {}" ::: ../*twoonly
```

## Generate matrix of values
```
join_files.sh *snpdistfreq | sort -n > cas12amod_6.snpdistfreqtable
```


## Normalization by total counts values
Scaling all samples by total counts

```
head -n 1 cas12amod_6.snpdistfreqtable | tr '\t' '\n' | grep .| perl -pe 's/.snpdistfreq//' | xargs -I xx wc -l ../xx >cas12amod_6.wc
head -n 1 cas12amod_6.snpdistfreqtable | tr '\t' '\n' | grep . | perl -pe 's/.snpdistfreq//' | xargs -I xx wc -l ../xx | awk '{print $1}' | tr '\n' '\t' | cb
```

## paste into excel

2MM_frequencyTable.xls


## rsync it over to the LSS folder


```
rsync -av /work/gif/severin/sashital-lab/2020_cas9-cas12amod/cas12amod/cas12a/03_2MM_KM01 /lss/research/sashital-lab/Karthik/ISUGIF/2020_cas12aNickase/cas12amod/cas12a/ &
